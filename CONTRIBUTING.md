# How To Contribute
Before contributing to this repository, please consider our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This repository contains a template that can be used to set up a very simple 'about me' page, that can be published online, hosted by GitHub, via GitHub Pages. As mentioned in our [README.md](README.md), the repository is developed as a teaching aid, to teach students how to use GitHub Pages to design and publish their own websites. To learn more about how you might use this template, just check out the repository's [wiki](https://github.com/SSLIS/gh-pages-about-me/wiki).

As a result, the repository is designed to be a bare-bones template, without much need for fine-tuning. Still, if you notice any bugs, or have any ideas for additional features that would open up new teaching opportunities, you are welcome to open an Issue, or submit a Pull Request.
